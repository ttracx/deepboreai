# DeepBoreAI

**Real-time, physics-informed AI platform for predictive drilling operations.**

DeepBoreAI is a vendor-agnostic, plug-and-play system that deploys intelligent ML agents to monitor, predict, and mitigate critical drilling issues in real time. Designed for both conventional and unconventional well types, it combines physics-informed machine learning with cutting-edge edge computing to deliver high-precision situational awareness on the drill floor.

- **Physics-Informed ML Agents** for:
  - Mechanical Sticking
  - Differential Sticking
  - Hole Cleaning
  - Mud Losses / Washouts
  - ROP Optimization
- **Self-Learning Models** that adapt to drilling conditions
- **Edge Processing** for ultra-low latency alerts
- **Interactive Dashboard** with real-time data and trend visualization
- **Historical Analytics + CSV Export**
- **One-Click Deployment with Docker Compose**
